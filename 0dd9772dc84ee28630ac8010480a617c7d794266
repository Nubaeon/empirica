  "mistake": "Used Claude Code built-in Task agents for parallel investigation instead of Empirica's own epistemic agent system (agent-spawn/agent-parallel). The built-in agents don't track epistemic state, don't link to sessions, and don't produce structured noetic artifacts.",
  "why_wrong": "Empirica's agent system exists precisely for this use case \u2014 parallel investigation with epistemic tracking. Using generic agents bypasses the framework we're building and loses the meta-learning data. The results were useful but unstructured and not linked to the session's epistemic graph.",
  "prevention": "When spawning investigation agents, always use Empirica's agent-spawn or agent-parallel commands. Reserve Claude Code's Task tool for non-epistemic work (file operations, simple searches).",
