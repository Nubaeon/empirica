  "finding": "Blindspot detector applied to climate science: structural topology layers (adjacent concept inference, cross-domain gap detection) work immediately. The interaction space between known tipping points (Arctic ice \u00d7 AMOC \u00d7 Amazon dieback) is the highest-value negative space - each studied individually, interactions barely mapped. Key limitation: self-labeling training flywheel is slow (decades not hours for validation). Would need expert-labeled bootstrap data. The approach adds most value in cross-discipline gap detection where no single expert sees the full topology.",
