Session demonstrated: systematic backlog cleanup, epistemic grounding (verify reality vs assumptions), strategic decision-making (BEADS investigation), and feature proposals (epistemic_importance). Updated system prompts for AI-first JSON across CANONICAL, GEMINI, and verified config.yml. Reorganized metacognitive signaling goals. Perfect example of epistemic transparency in practice - tracked learning explicitly, admitted unknowns, investigated systematically.
