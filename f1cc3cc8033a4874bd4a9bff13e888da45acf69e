  "unknown": "mq does not support .tex files and fails to extract headings from LaTeX-compiled PDFs. Heading detection in PDF parser likely relies on font-size heuristics that don't match LaTeX's formatting. Two potential fixes: (1) add .tex format support to mq (parse \\section{}, \\subsection{} etc.), (2) improve PDF heading detection for academic papers. This blocks using mq for paper review workflows.",
