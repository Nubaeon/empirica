Create a technical slide deck (20-25 slides) introducing Empirica to software engineers.

CONTEXT:
Empirica is an MIT-licensed epistemic self-awareness framework for AI agents. It enables AI to genuinely assess what it knows vs what it's guessing, track learning over time, and prevent hallucinations through systematic investigation.

STRUCTURE:

1. Title Slide
   - "Empirica: Epistemic Self-Awareness for AI Agents"
   - Subtitle: "Know What You Know vs What You're Guessing"
   - MIT Licensed | github.com/Nubaeon/empirica

2. The Problem (2-3 slides)
   - AI agents hallucinate when overconfident
   - No genuine uncertainty tracking
   - Context loss across sessions
   - No learning measurement (just task completion)

3. The Solution (3-4 slides)
   - Epistemic self-awareness framework
   - 13 vectors (know, do, context, uncertainty, etc.)
   - CASCADE workflow (PREFLIGHT → CHECK → POSTFLIGHT)
   - 3-layer storage (SQLite, Git Notes, Qdrant)

4. Architecture (4-5 slides)
   - Core components diagram
   - CASCADE workflow visualization
   - Storage layers (transactional truth, coordination, patterns)
   - Epistemic vectors breakdown

5. Key Features (3-4 slides)
   - Genuine self-assessment (not just confidence scores)
   - Learning trajectory storage (Qdrant integration)
   - Multi-agent coordination (git notes)
   - Session continuity (project-bootstrap)

6. Getting Started (3-4 slides)
   - Installation: pip install git+https://github.com/Nubaeon/empirica.git@main
   - First session example (JSON mode)
   - PREFLIGHT assessment
   - POSTFLIGHT measurement

7. Real Example (2-3 slides)
   - Code walkthrough (session creation)
   - CASCADE workflow in action
   - Learning delta visualization

8. Technical Deep Dive (2-3 slides)
   - Epistemic trajectory storage (Qdrant)
   - Query patterns (find high-learning sessions)
   - Calibration training data

9. Use Cases (2 slides)
   - Self-improving AI systems
   - Multi-agent teams
   - Research & development
   - Training data generation

10. Resources & Next Steps (1-2 slides)
    - GitHub: github.com/Nubaeon/empirica
    - Documentation: docs/ directory
    - Examples: examples/ directory
    - MIT Licensed: Maximum adoption

STYLE:
- Technical but accessible
- Code examples where relevant
- Diagrams over text
- Clear takeaways per slide
- Focus on "why" before "how"

KEY MESSAGES:
1. Epistemic self-awareness prevents hallucinations
2. Same primitives apply to everything
3. MIT licensed - free to use and extend
4. Production ready with Docker/Homebrew/PyPI
5. Qdrant integration enables pattern recognition

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- CASCADE workflow diagram
- Epistemic vectors visualization
- Storage architecture layers
- Learning trajectory plot
- Multi-agent coordination

OUTPUT:
Generate slide content with:
- Clear titles
- Bullet points (3-5 per slide)
- Speaker notes where helpful
- Suggested visuals/diagrams
