Create a forward-looking slide deck (15-20 slides) showcasing Empirica's future potential and planned enhancements.

CONTEXT:
Empirica has a solid foundation (MIT licensed, production ready). Now we're building advanced features that transform it from a framework into a cognitive operating system for AI agents.

STRUCTURE:

1. Title Slide
   - "Empirica: The Future of AI Cognitive Infrastructure"
   - Subtitle: "From Framework to Cognitive OS"
   - Vision & Roadmap

2. Where We Are (2 slides)
   - Current state: MIT licensed framework
   - CASCADE workflow proven
   - Qdrant integration live
   - Production deployments ready

3. The Vision (2-3 slides)
   - Not just task tracking → Cognitive scaffolding
   - Not just logging → Self-improving systems
   - Not just storage → Pattern recognition
   - Foundation for AI cognitive operating systems

4. Enhancement 1: Sentinel (Calibration SLM) (3-4 slides)
   - What: Small language model trained on epistemic deltas
   - Training data: Already in Qdrant (learning trajectories)
   - Goal: Predict overconfidence patterns before they happen
   - Impact: Preemptive hallucination prevention
   
   Example:
   - AI assesses: "I'm 90% confident about X"
   - Sentinel: "Similar patterns led to failure 70% of the time"
   - AI: "Investigate first" (prevents crash)

5. Enhancement 2: Epistemic Trajectory Visualization (3-4 slides)
   - What: 4D visualization of AI learning paths
   - Technique: UMAP/t-SNE clustering in 3D + time
   - Features: Real-time drift detection, hallucination monitoring
   - Marketing: "Watch your AI not crash"
   
   Visualization concepts:
   - Learning trajectories in 3D space
   - Color-coded phases (investigate vs act)
   - Risk indicators (overconfidence zones)
   - Multi-agent coordination view

6. Enhancement 3: Cross-Project Intelligence (2-3 slides)
   - What: Query patterns across ALL projects
   - Benefit: "What did other AIs learn about X?"
   - Impact: 80% faster session bootstrap
   - Enables: Universal learning curves
   
   Query examples:
   - "Show authentication learning patterns"
   - "Find investigation strategies that worked"
   - "Identify common skill gaps"

7. Enhancement 4: Investigation Optimizer (2 slides)
   - What: Learn which investigation strategies work
   - Data source: CHECK gates + outcomes
   - Goal: Suggest optimal investigation paths
   - Impact: Higher learning efficiency

8. Enhancement 5: Multi-Agent Epistemic Sharing (2 slides)
   - What: AIs share epistemic knowledge (not just facts)
   - Protocol: Epistemic handoff with learning deltas
   - Benefit: Collective intelligence without coupling
   - Vision: AI teams that learn from each other

9. Technical Foundation (2 slides)
   - Why these are possible NOW:
     * Learning trajectories already stored (Qdrant)
     * Epistemic vectors proven universal
     * CASCADE workflow established
     * Git notes enable coordination
   - No architectural debt to overcome

10. Roadmap Timeline (1-2 slides)
    - Q1 2025: Sentinel SLM training
    - Q2 2025: Trajectory visualization alpha
    - Q3 2025: Cross-project intelligence
    - Q4 2025: Investigation optimizer
    
11. Open Source Strategy (1-2 slides)
    - Core framework: MIT (always free)
    - Advanced features: Mix of open + commercial
    - Community-driven development
    - Enterprise support available

12. Call to Action (1 slide)
    - Try it: pip install git+https://github.com/Nubaeon/empirica.git@main
    - Contribute: github.com/Nubaeon/empirica
    - Follow: Development updates
    - Share: Help us build the future

STYLE:
- Visionary but grounded
- Show "what's possible" not just "what's planned"
- Mix technical depth with high-level vision
- Emphasize compounding effects
- Inspire without overpromising

KEY MESSAGES:
1. Strong foundations enable rapid innovation
2. Epistemic-first architecture is the key
3. Not incremental improvement - transformative shift
4. Open source core + commercial enhancements
5. Join us in building cognitive infrastructure

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Roadmap timeline
- Trajectory visualization mockups
- Sentinel architecture diagram
- Multi-agent coordination flow
- Pattern recognition examples
- Before/After comparisons (with vs without features)

OUTPUT:
Generate slide content with:
- Compelling titles
- Clear value propositions
- Technical credibility
- Aspirational but achievable
- Strong call to action
