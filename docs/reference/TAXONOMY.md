# Empirica Taxonomy

**The canonical reference for all Empirica concepts.**

Version: 1.0.0
Last updated: 2026-01-31

This document is the single source of truth for Empirica's concept space. AI agents consume it natively. Human developers use it as a vocabulary reference — the Rosetta Stone section maps every term to familiar equivalents.

---

## How to Read This

Each concept has:
- **Definition**: What it is, precisely
- **Category**: Where it belongs in the taxonomy
- **Properties**: Phase, mutability, temperature, scope (where applicable)
- **Relationships**: How it connects to other concepts

Concepts are grouped by category. The [Rosetta Stone](#rosetta-stone) at the end maps every term to developer-familiar equivalents.

## 1. Artifacts

Things that are created, persisted, and referenced. Split by the thinking phase that produces them.

### 1.1 Noetic Artifacts

Produced during investigation/thinking. Represent what was learned, what's unknown, and what failed.

| Artifact | Definition | Mutability | Storage |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Finding** | A discovered fact with measured impact (0.0–1.0). The atomic unit of learned knowledge. | Dynamic | WARM (SQLite) → SEARCH (Qdrant) → COLD (git notes) |
| **Unknown** | An identified gap in knowledge. Can be resolved when the answer is found. | Dynamic | WARM → SEARCH |
| **Dead-end** | A failed approach with documented reason. Prevents re-exploration of the same path. | Static once logged | WARM → SEARCH → COLD |
| **Mistake** | An error with root cause analysis, cost estimate, and prevention strategy. Training data for calibration. | Static once logged | WARM → SEARCH |
| **Blindspot** | A predicted knowledge gap inferred from negative space analysis. Generated by the Blindspot Detector, not manually logged. | Ephemeral (per-CHECK) | Computed, not stored |
| **Lesson** | Decayable procedural knowledge. Antibodies in the cognitive immune system — decays when contradicted by new findings. | Decaying | COLD (YAML) → SEARCH |

**Relationships:**
- Finding → decays related Lessons (immune system)
- Finding, Unknown, Dead-end, Mistake → link to both a Session (when) and optionally a Goal (what)
- Unknown → can be resolved (status: open → resolved)
- Blindspot → generated from topology of existing artifacts
- Dead-end → prevents agents from re-attempting the same approach

### 1.2 Praxic Artifacts

Produced during action/implementation. Represent what is being built and what was shipped.

| Artifact | Definition | Mutability | Storage |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Goal** | A structural work unit with an objective and completion criteria. Persists across sessions. Contains subtasks. | Dynamic | WARM (SQLite) |
| **Subtask** | A decomposed work unit within a goal. Has importance level and optional dependencies. Completed with evidence. | Dynamic | WARM (SQLite) |
| **Commit** | A code change checkpoint in version control. The atomic unit of shipped work. | Static once created | COLD (git) |

**Relationships:**
- Goal → contains Subtasks (1:N)
- Goal → links to Findings, Unknowns, Dead-ends, Mistakes (semantic association)
- Subtask → completed with evidence (commit hash, file path, test result)
- Commit → captures praxic output, closes the implementation loop

---

## 2. Epistemic State

The measurement of what an agent knows, how confident it is, and how that changes over time.

### 2.1 Vectors

A vector is a single dimension of epistemic state, rated 0.0 to 1.0. There are 13 vectors across 4 tiers.

#### Tier 0 — Gate (15% weight)

| Vector | Measures | Threshold |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **engagement** | Quality of collaborative intelligence. Is meaningful work possible? | ≥ 0.6 to proceed |

#### Tier 1 — Foundation (35% weight)

| Vector | Measures |
|--------|----------|
| **know** | Domain understanding. What do I actually know about this? |
| **do** | Execution capability. Can I perform the required actions? |
| **context** | Surrounding information. Do I have enough situational awareness? |

#### Tier 2 — Comprehension (25% weight)

| Vector | Measures |
|--------|----------|
| **clarity** | Requirement understanding. Do I know what's being asked? |
| **coherence** | Internal consistency. Does my understanding fit together? |
| **signal** | Pattern detection. Am I detecting relevant information? |
| **density** | Information richness. How much useful data do I have? |

#### Tier 3 — Execution (25% weight)

| Vector | Measures |
|--------|----------|
| **state** | System awareness. Do I understand the current state of things? |
| **change** | Delta detection. How much has changed since my last assessment? |
| **completion** | Phase-aware progress. How complete is the current phase? (See: Phase-Aware Completion) |
| **impact** | Significance. How important is this work? |

#### Meta

| Vector | Measures | Note |
|--------|----------|------|
| **uncertainty** | Doubt magnitude. How unsure am I? | Inverted: higher = more uncertain. Historically overestimated. |

#### Phase-Aware Completion

Completion means different things depending on the current thinking phase:

| Phase | Completion question | 1.0 means |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Noetic | "Have I learned enough to proceed?" | Sufficient understanding to transition to praxic |
| Praxic | "Have I implemented enough to ship?" | Meets stated objective, ready to commit |

### 2.2 Assessments

An assessment is a snapshot of all 13 vectors at a point in time. There are three types, corresponding to CASCADE phases:

| Assessment | When | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| **PREFLIGHT** | Before starting work | Establish baseline. BEGIN the epistemic transaction. |
| **CHECK** | At noetic→praxic transition | Sentinel gate. Validates readiness to act. |
| **POSTFLIGHT** | After completing work | Measure learning. COMMIT the epistemic transaction. |

### 2.3 Derived Measurements

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Delta** | The vector-wise difference between two assessments (typically PREFLIGHT → POSTFLIGHT). The quantified learning signal. |
| **Calibration** | Systematic bias in self-assessment, measured over many PREFLIGHT→POSTFLIGHT cycles. Expressed as bias corrections per vector. |
| **Drift** | Divergence between an agent's confidence and actual performance over time. Detected by comparing sequential assessments. |
| **Bias correction** | A per-vector adjustment (positive or negative) derived from calibration data. Applied to raw self-assessments to improve accuracy. Stored in `.breadcrumbs.yaml`. |

**Relationships:**
- Assessment → contains 13 Vectors + reasoning
- PREFLIGHT + POSTFLIGHT → produces Delta
- Many Deltas → produces Calibration (Bayesian belief update)
- Sequential Assessments → enables Drift detection
- Bias corrections → applied at CHECK to compute readiness gate

---

## 3. Phases

### 3.1 Thinking Phases (AI-chosen)

The agent chooses which phase it's in based on the nature of its current work.

| Phase | Mode | Activity | Produces |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **Noetic** | Investigation | Explore, hypothesize, search, read, question | Noetic artifacts (findings, unknowns, dead-ends) |
| **Praxic** | Action | Execute, write, commit, deploy | Praxic artifacts (goals completed, code committed) |

The CHECK gate controls the noetic→praxic transition. Sentinel enforces it.

### 3.2 Workflow Phases (CASCADE)

The mandatory measurement framework. Every significant task follows this sequence:

```
PREFLIGHT → [work] → CHECK → [work] → POSTFLIGHT
  BEGIN       noetic    GATE    praxic    COMMIT
```

| Phase | Role | Analogy |
|-------|------|---------|
| **PREFLIGHT** | Baseline measurement. Opens the epistemic transaction. | `BEGIN TRANSACTION` |
| **CHECK** | Sentinel gate. Evaluates readiness to transition from noetic to praxic. | Quality gate / code review |
| **POSTFLIGHT** | Learning measurement. Closes the epistemic transaction. Captures delta. | `COMMIT` |

---

## 4. Structural Concepts

### 4.1 Transaction

An epistemic transaction is a measurement window bounded by PREFLIGHT (BEGIN) and POSTFLIGHT (COMMIT). Between measurements, epistemic state is continuous and wave-like. Assessments collapse it to discrete, trackable vectors.

**Properties:**
- Bounded by coherence of changes, not by goals or time
- Multiple goals can exist within one transaction
- One goal can span multiple transactions
- Transactions survive compaction — file-based `transaction_id` tracking persists across sessions
- A single transaction can span 1..N sessions (PREFLIGHT in session A, POSTFLIGHT in session B)
- Tracked via `transaction_id` (UUID) stored in all artifact tables and reflexes

### 4.2 Session

A temporal interval corresponding to one context window. Created on conversation start or after compaction. Multiple Empirica sessions can exist within one Claude Code conversation.

**Properties:**
- Bounded by context windows (compactions create new sessions)
- Purpose: audit trail, calibration checkpoints, epistemic snapshots
- Artifacts link to sessions for temporal provenance ("when was this discovered?")

### 4.3 Goal (structural)

A persistent work unit that outlives sessions. Owns subtasks and links to epistemic artifacts.

**Properties:**
- Persists across sessions indefinitely
- Purpose: structural organization, progress tracking
- Artifacts link to goals for semantic organization ("what work does this belong to?")

### 4.4 The Three Axes

Sessions, goals, and transactions are orthogonal, not hierarchical:

| Concept | Axis | Bounded by | Persists across sessions? |
|---------|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Session** | Temporal | Context windows | No — each is an interval |
| **Goal** | Structural | Completion criteria | Yes — indefinitely |
| **Transaction** | Measurement | Coherence of changes | Yes — file-based tracking survives compaction |

**Cardinality:** 1 transaction : 1..N sessions (spans compaction). 1 session : 0..N transactions.

**Triple linkage:** Every artifact carries `session_id` (when), `goal_id` (what), and `transaction_id` (which measurement window). This is intentional — don't collapse them.

## 5. Systems

### 5.1 CASCADE

The workflow framework. Enforces measurement discipline: PREFLIGHT → CHECK → POSTFLIGHT. Named for the phase sequence that cascades from investigation to action.

### 5.2 Sentinel

The enforcement system. Gates praxic actions (Edit, Write, NotebookEdit) based on epistemic readiness.

**Readiness gate:** `know >= 0.70 AND uncertainty <= 0.35` (after bias correction)

**Modes:**
| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `controller` | Actively blocks insufficient confidence (default) |
| `observer` | Logs warnings but doesn't block |

**Anti-gaming:** Detects rushed assessments (CHECK < 30s after PREFLIGHT with no noetic artifacts).

### 5.3 Cognitive Immune System

Pattern: Lessons are antibodies (procedural knowledge). Findings are antigens (new evidence).

When a finding is logged:
1. Keywords extracted from finding text
2. `decay_related_lessons()` scans lesson YAML files
3. Matching lessons have `source_confidence` reduced
4. Minimum confidence floor: 0.3 (lessons never fully die)

**Central tolerance:** `domain` parameter scopes decay to prevent autoimmune attacks — a finding about "auth" only decays auth-related lessons.

### 5.4 Tool Router

Maps epistemic vectors + task intent → behavioral mode + specific tools/agents/skills.

**Architecture:**
```
VectorRouter:  vectors → mode (investigate, implement, clarify, ...)
ToolRouter:    vectors + task → mode + tools (agents, skills, MCP tools)
```

**Modes:** `load_context`, `investigate`, `clarify`, `confident_implementation`, `cautious_implementation`

### 5.5 Blindspot Detector

Infers predicted knowledge gaps from the topology of existing artifacts.

**Pipeline:** Existing artifacts → topology analysis → negative space → predicted blindspots (with severity and confidence)

**Integrated into:** CHECK phase (auto-runs after assessment, critical blindspots override decision to "investigate").

---

## 6. Context

Sources of information that feed into an agent's epistemic state.

| Concept | Definition | Mutability |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Bootstrap** | Project context loading. Retrieves active goals, recent findings, open unknowns, dead-ends. Depth scales with uncertainty. | Dynamic (reflects current project state) |
| **Ref-doc** | A reference document in the project knowledge base. Added manually or via ingestion. | Static once added |
| **Protocol** | Workflow configuration defining user preferences, behavioral rules, and operational boundaries. The EWM (Empirica Workflow Model). | Static per user |
| **Source** | Any external information source (documentation, API, codebase) consulted during investigation. | External |

---

## 7. Agents

| Agent | Role | Capability |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **AI Lead** | Primary orchestrating AI (e.g., Claude Code). Manages CASCADE, creates goals, logs artifacts. | Full read/write/execute |
| **Domain Agent** | Specialized investigator spawned for focused analysis. Types: security, architecture, performance, UX. | Scoped read/write within domain |
| **Sentinel** | Enforcement system (not a conversational agent). Gates praxic actions based on epistemic readiness. | Gate/block/override |
| **Human** | The user. Makes final decisions, provides requirements, approves plans. | Override/approve/direct |

## Rosetta Stone

Every Empirica term mapped to its closest developer-familiar equivalent. Where the Empirica concept differs from the analogue, the difference is noted.

| Empirica Term | Developer Analogue | Key Difference |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Finding** | Investigation note / spike result | Has measured impact (0.0–1.0), triggers immune decay |
| **Unknown** | Open question / TODO | Formally tracked, resolvable, linked to goals |
| **Dead-end** | Failed spike / abandoned approach | Persisted to prevent re-exploration by any agent |
| **Mistake** | Post-mortem / incident item | Has root cause vector, cost estimate, prevention strategy |
| **Blindspot** | Coverage gap / unknown unknown | Computed from negative space, not manually identified |
| **Lesson** | Best practice / runbook entry | Decays when contradicted by evidence (immune system) |
| **Goal** | Epic / user story | Persists across sessions, owns epistemic artifacts |
| **Subtask** | Task / ticket | Completed with evidence (not just status change) |
| **Vector** | Metric dimension | Self-assessed, bias-corrected, 13 dimensions |
| **Assessment** | Health check / status report | Formal snapshot of all 13 vectors with reasoning |
| **Delta** | Diff / change measurement | Vector-wise difference = quantified learning |
| **Calibration** | Accuracy analysis / bias audit | Bayesian update from accumulated prediction errors |
