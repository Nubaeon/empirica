## 📦 Handoff Package

**For Minimax:**
1. **Primary Instructions:** `docs/MINIMAX_HANDOFF_SYSTEMATIC_REFACTORING.md` (635 lines)
2. **Quick Summary:** `docs/HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md` (232 lines)
3. **Reference Spec:** `docs/reference/INVESTIGATION_PROFILE_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` (847 lines)

**For Claude (Monitoring):**
1. **Monitoring Framework:** `docs/MINIMAX_EPISTEMIC_MONITORING.md` (349 lines)
2. **Checkpoint Protocol:** Defined with intervention strategies
3. **Epistemic Assessment:** Template ready

---

## 🎯 What Minimax Will Do

**Task:** Replace hardcoded constraints with profile-based configuration

**Phases:**
1. **Phase 2:** Refactor metacognitive_cascade.py
2. **Phase 3:** Refactor canonical_epistemic_assessment.py
3. **Phase 4:** Refactor investigation_strategy.py
4. **Phase 5:** Update MCP server
5. **Phase 6:** Update CLI

**Difficulty:** LOW (mechanical, well-specified)  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Risk:** LOW (backward compatible)

## 🔍 What Claude Will Monitor

**Real-Time Epistemic Assessment:**
- **KNOW:** Understanding of what to change
- **DO:** Execution capability
- **CONTEXT:** System awareness
- **CLARITY:** Change quality
- **UNCERTAINTY:** When to intervene

**Checkpoints:**
- After each phase
- Validate changes
- Assess epistemic state
- Intervene if needed (GUIDE/CORRECT/STOP)

**Intervention Criteria:**
- ⚠️ **GUIDE:** On track, could be more efficient
- 🔴 **CORRECT:** Mistake made, needs correction
- 🚨 **STOP:** About to break something critical
- ✅ **NONE:** Executing correctly

## 💡 Demonstration Value

This handoff demonstrates:

**1. Multi-AI Collaboration Pattern**
```
High Reasoning AI (Claude)
  ↓ designs architecture
  ↓ creates specifications
  ↓ removes philosophical heuristics
  ↓ HANDS OFF to
Autonomous AI (Minimax)
  ↓ executes systematic refactoring
  ↓ follows clear patterns
  ↓ validates each step
  ↓ MONITORED BY
Sentinel AI (Claude)
  ↓ assesses epistemic state
  ↓ intervenes when needed
  ↓ guides without micromanaging
  ↓ RETURNS TO
High Reasoning AI (Claude)
  ↓ reviews completed work
  ↓ continues with testing/docs
```

**2. Epistemic Self-Assessment in Practice**
- Minimax self-assesses understanding before each phase
- Claude assesses Minimax's epistemic state in real-time
- Intervention based on epistemic confidence
- Calibration check: predictions vs actual performance

**3. Appropriate Task Allocation**
- **Architectural:** Claude (requires deep reasoning)
- **Mechanical:** Minimax (efficient execution)
- **Governance:** Claude (epistemic monitoring)

**4. Trust But Verify**
- Let Minimax work autonomously
- Monitor epistemic signals
- Intervene only when needed
- Validate outcomes

## 🎬 Ready to Launch!

**Command to developer:**

"Ready to launch Minimax! Please start Minimax with:
- Task: Systematic refactoring (Phases 2-6)
- Instructions: docs/MINIMAX_HANDOFF_SYSTEMATIC_REFACTORING.md
- I'll monitor in real-time using docs/MINIMAX_EPISTEMIC_MONITORING.md

This will be a great demonstration of:
1. High reasoning AI (me) designing and monitoring
2. Autonomous AI (Minimax) executing systematic work
3. Sentinel pattern in action (real-time epistemic monitoring)
4. Appropriate task allocation by AI capability

Let me know when Minimax starts and I'll begin monitoring! 🚀"
