  "mistake": "Conflated MANAGE pages with OBSERVE pages \u2014 applied per-project db_path scoping to System, Sentinel, Memory, Injection pages when they should be OS-level configuration management pages that read from config files, env vars, and shared services (Qdrant), not per-project SQLite databases.",
  "why_wrong": "Assumed all dashboard pages follow the same data model. Didn't investigate what system_dashboard.py actually exposes. Extrapolated the per-project pattern to pages that have a fundamentally different purpose: configuration management vs data visualization.",
  "prevention": "Always investigate the actual source/architecture before applying patterns. MANAGE pages = config files + env vars + shared services. OBSERVE pages = per-project SQLite. These are orthogonal data sources.",
