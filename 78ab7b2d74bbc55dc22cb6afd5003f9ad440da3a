All the technical capability in the world is wasted if users approach with tool/oracle framing. Empirica's deepest function: teaching the collaborative partner frame through practice. The 13 vectors, the CHECK gates, the PREFLIGHT rituals - these aren't just measurement tools, they're behavioral scaffolding that trains humans AND AI to work together with mutual epistemic awareness. Maybe the only framing that matters for trustworthy AI.",
