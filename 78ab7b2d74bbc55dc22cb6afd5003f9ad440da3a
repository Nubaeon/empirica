The skeptics (LeCun) see a tool, the zoomers see an oracle, neither sees a partner. The real unlock isn't raw capability but MUTUAL EPISTEMIC CALIBRATION - human and AI each knowing their limits, compensating for blind spots. Empirica measures not 'is AI smart' but 'does AI know what it knows' - foundation for genuine collaboration where human and AI mirror each other's epistemic states.",
