When AI hits low confidence, instead of dead-end or confabulation, surface which humans in org have calibrated expertise in that domain + their trained AI partner. Query flows to highest-confidence human+AI pair. Requires: (1) expertise mapping with calibrated scores, (2) per-partner AI calibration profiles, (3) epistemic routing matching query uncertainty to human expertise, (4) collaborative handoff to human+AI unit. Transforms law firm into calibrated knowledge network. The 'I don't know' becomes a connection point, not a failure.",
