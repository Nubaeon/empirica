This is Claude Code platform behavior, not an Empirica bug. Impact: parallel investigation patterns break when sentinel blocks any single call. Workaround: sequence hook-gated calls (Bash) separately from non-gated calls (MCP). Fix: either (a) Claude Code shouldn't cancel siblings on hook block, or (b) sentinel should whitelist read-only investigation commands.",
