All artifact tables (project_unknowns, project_findings, project_dead_ends) have goal_id columns.

In the canonical bug scenario (3 task unknowns resolved + 6 research unknowns unresolved), KNOW grounding improves from 0.33 to 0.62 \u2014 87.5% improvement. Mistakes are NOT scope-weighted as all mistakes are task-relevant regardless of goal linkage.",
