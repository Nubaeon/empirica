"""
`lesson-create` must say whether the lesson reached the shared pool.

Federation used to run only in the POSTFLIGHT sweep. Between create and
POSTFLIGHT the lesson existed, carried `sharing_policy: org`, read as shared in
every local surface, and was invisible to every peer — while the receipt handed
back an id and said nothing. Handing that id to a peer is the obvious next move
and it failed for a window closing at POSTFLIGHT, or never.

A peer's `--from-global` ingest of an id published minutes earlier was correctly
refused on 2026-09-05. No local test could have caught it: every read on the
authoring side resolves locally and passes.

These assert the CONTRACT — a caller can distinguish published, deferred and
not-requested — rather than which mechanism does the publishing.
