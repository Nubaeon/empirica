"""Gardening must reach notes, and reach them the way sqlite does.

Notes are the canonical log — `rebuild --qdrant` imports them back INTO sqlite —
so a note that disagrees with sqlite is not a stale copy, it is a pending revert.

The two halves needed different fixes, measured 2026-09-06:

    delete-artifacts   DID reach notes but DESTROYED the ref (journey lost)
    *-resolve          reached notes NOT AT ALL (zero references in either handler)

So delete archives and resolve stamps. **Archiving on resolve would be the
obvious-looking mistake** — sqlite keeps resolved rows, so dropping them out of
the active namespace is a second divergence in the opposite direction.

EVERY assertion here is paired with its opposite. The acceptance invariant
"active notes reproduce sqlite" passes trivially on two empty stores, and three
practices shipped a control that could not fire on the day this was designed.
