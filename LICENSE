FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================

Q: Can I use Empirica in my company's internal tools?
A: Yes, under AGPL-3.0, as long as you're not providing it as a network service 
   to external users.

Q: Can I build a SaaS product with Empirica?
A: Yes, but you must either (a) open-source your entire application under 
   AGPL-3.0, or (b) purchase a Commercial License.

Q: What if I only use Empirica's API without modifying it?
A: If you're providing Empirica as a network service to users, AGPL-3.0's 
   network provision clause applies. You need a Commercial License for 
   proprietary use.

Q: Can I train AI models using Empirica?
A: Yes, under AGPL-3.0. If you're providing those models as a service, 
   see the question above.

Q: What counts as "modifying" Empirica?
A: Changing Empirica's source code, extending its classes, or integrating 
   it in ways that create derivative works. Simply using Empirica's API 
   or importing its modules is not modification.

Q: Can I fork Empirica and create my own version?
A: Yes, under AGPL-3.0, but your fork must also be AGPL-3.0 and open-source.

Q: How much is the Commercial License?
A: Contact licensing@empirica.dev for pricing. Pricing varies based on 
   company size, use case, and support requirements.
