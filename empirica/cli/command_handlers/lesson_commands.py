    receipt that returned an id and said nothing about the pool. Handing that id
    to a peer is the obvious next move and it failed for a window that closed at
    POSTFLIGHT, or never, if the session ended without one. A peer's ingest of an
    id published minutes earlier was correctly refused on 2026-09-05.
