"""
Empirica Doctor - install + mesh-participation health check.

Sibling to `diagnose` (which is Claude Code-centric). `doctor` checks the
state of an Empirica install regardless of frontend — install presence,
project state, cortex connectivity, ntfy mesh, listener arming, MCP server
config. Designed to be the single command an operator runs on a peer
machine to audit its install + mesh participation surface (closes
prop_vnsvs6th6bc5lhprbhylvdxwmi from cortex AI, 2026-05-18).

Designed to be callable from Claude Desktop via the empirica-mcp `doctor`
tool, returning structured JSON the AI can interpret without shell access.

Output modes:
  --output json     (default) — machine-readable
  --output human    colored text with fix hints

Exit codes:
  0 — all checks passed (or only WARN)
  1 — one or more FAIL checks
  2 — one or more WARN checks (no FAIL) — only when `--strict-warn`
