    citing it (spec §5, decision f5c59ec8). Without it a source can only ever be

    was wrong or because the REASONING from it was wrong, and those are not

    systematically slander good sources, so ``implicated`` is only ever true when the
    caller names the source explicitly (``source_implicated``: a list of ids, or
    ``true`` to implicate every cited source). Undeclared outcomes still count toward
    relevance and stability — just not accuracy.

    Events are appended to ``epistemic_sources.lifecycle_audit_log`` (the same log
    that already carries ``repointed`` and archive events), because metrics are
    DERIVED on read, never stored: a stored score drifts from its evidence, which is

    `log-artifacts` creates, `resolve-artifacts` closes, `delete-artifacts` removes.
    None of them can change a field, so an artifact that is real and correctly typed
    but carries a wrong impact score or a contaminated `epistemic_source` had no
    correction path at all in the CLI. The daemon has had `PATCH /artifacts/{id}`
    since v0.5; this closes the asymmetry from the side David calls the real toolset.

    Rejected field names are REPORTED, not silently dropped — a correction that says
    success while changing nothing is the failure this whole surface exists to end.
