"""Gardening must reach git notes, and reach them the way sqlite does.

Notes are the canonical log — `rebuild --qdrant` force-imports them back INTO
sqlite — so a note that disagrees with sqlite is not a stale copy, it is a
pending revert. Gardening operated on sqlite alone, so gardened noise re-surfaced
on any notes-reading path.

**The two halves needed different fixes, and the difference is the whole design.**
Measured 2026-09-06:

    delete-artifacts   DID reach notes, via `git update-ref -d` — but DESTROYED
                       the ref. The row leaves the active graph, correct, and the
                       journey leaves with it.
    *-resolve          reached notes NOT AT ALL. Zero references in the single or
                       batch resolve handlers.

So delete changes from destroy to ARCHIVE, and resolve gains a stamp it never had.
Mirroring sqlite exactly, which is the acceptance invariant: sqlite DELETES noise
rows and KEEPS resolved ones with their resolution fields. Archiving a resolved
note would have been the obvious-looking mistake — it would drop resolved rows
out of the active graph while sqlite kept them, a second divergence in the
opposite direction.

Layout, parallel namespaces so the journey survives remotely too:

    refs/notes/empirica/<type>/<id>           active — mirrors sqlite
    refs/notes/empirica-archive/<type>/<id>   the journey

Nine store modules each hand-roll `git notes --ref=… add -f`, which is why the
gap existed in all of them simultaneously: there was nowhere central to put this.
It lives here once, and both callers import it.
