"""Repair historical notes/sqlite divergence, and let `doctor` report it.

The write path is correct from 697bd613 forward. Everything gardened BEFORE that
left notes and sqlite disagreeing, and because `rebuild --qdrant` imports notes
back INTO sqlite, that backlog is a set of pending reverts rather than stale
copies.

Two divergences, mirroring the two write-path halves:

    notes-only     sqlite deleted the artifact; the note is still active  -> ARCHIVE
    unstamped      sqlite resolved it; the note never learned             -> STAMP

**Dedupe by notes ROOT, not by working directory.** One practice here has 22
worktrees sharing a single notes history; reconciling per-worktree would process
the same store 22 times, and a run that quietly skips 21 paths is indistinguishable
from one that had 1 path to begin with. So the collapse is REPORTED, not silent.

Dry-run is the default and the plan names every artifact id. The receipt is the
point: this rewrites history-adjacent state, and an operator who cannot read what
moved cannot disagree with it.
