#: The ONLY collections a rebuild may drop — the ones `_embed_project_from_db`
#: can actually put back. Deriving the drop set from the refill set is the whole
#: point: two hand-maintained lists drifted, and the drift was silent and lossy.
#:
#: `recreate_project_collections` used to drop TEN collections while the refill
#: covered three (docs / memory / eidetic, via upsert_memory, embed_eidetic and
#: embed_project_code). `rebuild.py` contains ZERO references to decisions or
#: assumptions. So `empirica rebuild --qdrant-only` — which the gardening
#: guidance recommends as the way to refresh embedded payloads — permanently
#: destroyed every point in the other seven and reported success.
#:
#: Measured 2026-09-06 on one box: 4,781 points across up to 24 practices —
#: calibration 1,960, episodic 1,688, goals 1,036, decisions 92, assumptions 5.
#: Not recoverable: nothing re-embeds them, so the loss is silent AND permanent.
#: Decisions and assumptions JOINED this set on 2026-09-06, once `rebuild.py`
#: grew `_embed_typed_decisions` / `_embed_typed_assumptions`. That is the
#: intended direction of travel: a collection becomes droppable by acquiring a
#: refiller, never by someone deciding it is safe to lose.
