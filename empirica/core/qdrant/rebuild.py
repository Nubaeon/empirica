Qdrant rebuild from SQLite — rebuild all collections from persistent DB state.

Used by `empirica rebuild --qdrant` to restore Qdrant after:
- Model/dimension change (e.g., nomic-embed-text → qwen3-embedding)
- Qdrant data loss or fresh deployment
- Collection corruption

Iterates all workspace projects, recreates collections at current dimensions,
and re-embeds all artifacts from each project's sessions.db.
