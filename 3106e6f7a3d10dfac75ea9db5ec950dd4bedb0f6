Options: (A) Keep session-scoped - simpler, captures cumulative session learning, (B) Add transaction_id parameter - more precise per-transaction calibration, (C) Hybrid - use transaction_id when available, fall back to session. Trade-off: precision vs complexity. Current goal-weighting already reduces noise from unscoped artifacts.",
