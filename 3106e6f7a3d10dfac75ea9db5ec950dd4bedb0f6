(2) POSTFLIGHT shows detailed gaps in response JSON. For AI: prior adjustments ARE actionable (applied before work). Post-hoc gaps are informational (work already done). For human: both useful for trust calibration and research. Recommendation: prior adjustments = silent AI internalization, post-hoc gaps = human oversight dashboard, severe miscalibration (>0.3 gap) = surface to AI.",
