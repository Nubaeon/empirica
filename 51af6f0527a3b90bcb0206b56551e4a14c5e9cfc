  "finding": "Recursive self-improvement via epistemic training data: Empirica's accumulated calibration data (2535+ observations, bias corrections, dead-ends, mistakes, trajectories) constitutes a training dataset for metacognition. Fine-tuning open weights models on this data would train accurate self-assessment and epistemic loop closure INTO the weights. The training signal is \"be more accurate about your knowledge state\" - a safer optimization target than raw capability. This closes the self-improvement loop through training cycles rather than real-time weight modification, while remaining fully auditable (all training examples in git notes).",
