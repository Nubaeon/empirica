# Refactor Decision

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ | **Time:** 30 minutes | **Status:** Coming Soon

Choose between multiple valid refactoring approaches.

## The Scenario

A codebase needs refactoring. There are three valid approaches, each with tradeoffs. You must investigate, weigh options, and make a defensible choice.

## Why This Is Epistemic

- Multiple valid paths = **genuine uncertainty**
- Must evaluate **tradeoffs** (no obvious winner)
- Log **reasoning** for your choice
- Dead-ends when approaches don't pan out

## Coming Soon

This project will include:
- Code needing refactoring
- Three distinct approaches
- Evaluation criteria
- Guided decision-making with Empirica
