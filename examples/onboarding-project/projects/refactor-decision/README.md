# Refactor Decision

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ | **Time:** 30 minutes

Choose between multiple valid refactoring approaches.

## The Scenario

You've inherited a payment processing module with growing complexity. There are three valid refactoring approaches, each with real tradeoffs. You must investigate, weigh options, and make a defensible choice.

## Why This Is Epistemic

- Multiple valid paths = **genuine uncertainty**
- Must evaluate **tradeoffs** (no obvious winner)
- Log **reasoning** for your choice
- Dead-ends when approaches don't pan out
- Your confidence in the "right" choice should evolve
