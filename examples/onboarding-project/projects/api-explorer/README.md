# API Explorer

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ | **Time:** 25 minutes | **Status:** Coming Soon

Learn an unfamiliar API while tracking your understanding.

## The Scenario

You need to integrate with a REST API you've never used. The docs are incomplete. You must experiment, log discoveries, and build confidence through exploration.

## Why This Is Epistemic

- Start with **low knowledge** of the API
- **Experiment** to discover behavior
- Log **findings** as you understand endpoints
- Track **unknowns** about undocumented features

## Coming Soon

This project will include:
- A mock API server
- Incomplete documentation
- Hidden endpoints to discover
- Guided walkthrough with Empirica
