# API Explorer

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ | **Time:** 25 minutes

Learn an unfamiliar API while tracking your understanding.

## The Scenario

You need to integrate with a REST API for a task management service. The official docs are incomplete - they only document 2 of the 5 endpoints. You must experiment, discover hidden functionality, and build confidence through exploration.

## Why This Is Epistemic

- Start with **low knowledge** of the API
- **Experiment** to discover behavior
- Log **findings** as you understand endpoints
- Track **unknowns** about undocumented features
- Experience **genuine discovery** as you explore

## Your Mission

1. Start the API server
2. Read the (incomplete) docs
