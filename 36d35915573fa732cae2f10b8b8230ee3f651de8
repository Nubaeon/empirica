Instead of node sharing (which creates surgically-excluded packet filter entries), the external user joins your tailnet directly via `tailscale login` with your tailnet's URL, then uses `tailscale switch` to move between their own tailnet and yours. This makes them a full member, packet filter includes them, SSH works normally. Philipp's new IP on our tailnet: 100.100.3.125 (vs old shared IP 100.79.215.20 which was excluded).",
