  "finding": "Theoretical grounding for blindspot detector: Friston's free-energy principle and predictive coding establish that confabulation is structural in prediction-based systems (biological and artificial). Hallucination = gap-filling with most coherent inference. Therefore: if you can map the gaps (negative space in knowledge topology), you can predict WHERE confabulation will occur. Empirica's epistemic vectors (uncertainty, know, signal, density) already measure confabulation-likelihood conditions. The blindspot detector extends this by predicting the LOCATION of likely confabulation, not just the probability. One-liner: 'You can't stop a prediction engine from guessing, but you can predict where its guesses are most likely to be wrong.'",
